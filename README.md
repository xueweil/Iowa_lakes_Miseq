#Attached the the R script to look at the seq data. To examine the seq data, you will need three files: 1)shared, 2) tax, 3)map file. The mapfile is all the relevant #info, like nutrients, sample data, etc. Feel free to delete some of the nutrients column if you don't need it. Do not delete the Mothur_ID column. That is needed to #link the seq files.

#If you want to play with the data, you can use the HABs tutorial (link)

#This is the link to the seq reference database. If you browse through the database, the cyano sequences are identified to the genus level (copy and paste the name #into NCBI to cross validate). I'm not sure why Micah did not fix this in her thesis. I know you are busy but if you get to this sequencing data, just know that it is #not a species level.
